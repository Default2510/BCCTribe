			<p class="short-description">We all need friends to help us up and onward in life. Relationships can be hard and messy, and even hurtful at times. We also know that when we strive to do relationships God's way, we can do great things together. Tribe is a place where true kingdom friendships are formed. Kingdom relationships are different because we are focused on being like Jesus, together. Here, we put our hearts into supporting one another in and outside of Tribe. Come to a place where you can belong, and where you can help others know they do, too.</p>

			<p class="short-description text-dark">Do you have a supporting cast to your dream? In Tribe we believe that each and every person has been given a purpose by God. That purpose is probably already on your mind and in your heart. Not only do you get to discover your purpose, but we get to support you in it. In this season of life where you find your God-given dream, character is developed and experience gained to walk out your purpose for the rest of your life. As you walk that purpose out, be encouraged to see God's kingdom expand through it. Come share your dream with us.</p>
